## API Server

API Server : It acts as front end for Kubernetes.
The users, devices, temrinals all  communicate with API Server to interact with kubernetes cluseter

## etcd
etcd: It is a distributed reliable Key value store used by kubernetes to store all data used to
manage the cluster.

Think of it this way, when you have multiple nodes and multiple masters in your cluster,
etcd stores all that information on all the nodes in the cluster in a distributed manner.

Etcd is responsible for implementing locks within the cluster to ensure that there are no conflicts between the masters.

## Scheduler

The scheduler is responsible for distributing work or containers across multiple nodes.
It looks for newly created containers and assigns them to nodes.

## Controller

The controllers are the brain behind orchestration. They're responsible for noticing and responding when nodes, containers or endpoints goes down.
The controllers make decisions to bring up new containers in such cases.


## Container Runtime

The container runtime is the underlying software that is used to run containers.
In our case, it happens to be Docker, but there are other options as well.

## Kubelet
And finally, kubelet is the agent that runs on each node in the cluster.
The agent is responsible for making sure that the containers are running on the nodes as expected.
