This theme comes with the [@astrojs/mdx](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/) integration installed and configured in your `astro.config.mjs` config file. If you prefer not to use MDX, you can disable support by removing the integration from your config file.

## Remaining July 2023



## Example

Here is how you import and use a UI component inside of MDX.  
When you open this page in the browser, you should see the clickable button below.

import HeaderLink from '../../components/HeaderLink.astro';

<HeaderLink href="#" onclick="alert('clicked!')">
	Embedded component in MDX
</HeaderLink>

- **Note:** [Client Directives](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/directives-reference/#client-directives) are still required to create interactive components. Otherwise, all components in your MDX will render as static HTML (no JavaScript) by default.
